#### make a flask app with a /hello endpoint that returns hello world  

Ok, here are the changes:

```python
app.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
=======
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This code creates a Flask app and adds a `/hello` endpoint that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed.

_Applied edit to app.py_  
_8f7db45 aider: Added a /hello endpoint that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed._
